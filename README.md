# JustWatch Widgets

WordPress plugin that adds a Gutenberg block for embedding JustWatch widgets using TMDB or IMDB IDs.

## Features

- Global defaults in wp-admin settings.
- Per-block overrides in the block editor.
- Language override (limited to tested languages).
- Offer label, icon scale, max services, heading, border, and fallback message controls.
- Configurable wrapper margin as a global default and per-block override.
- Dynamic server-side render via block `render.php`.
- Icon scale option labels shown as percentages (for example `60%`, `100%`, `200%`).
- Uninstall cleanup removes saved plugin options when plugin is deleted.

The plugin also inserts the JustWatch code snippet into your site footer globally, which provides backward compatibility if you were previously using HTML code to embed widgets. Once you have the plugin installed, you can delete the code snippet you added to your theme.
